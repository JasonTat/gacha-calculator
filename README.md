Hi! This is just a full stack personal project that I'm creating in ASP.NET Blazor + MS SQL Server. 

Currently, the games I will be supporting are:
- Honkai Star Rail
- Genshin Impact
- Arknights
- Punishing Gray Raven

There could be more, but these are the ones that I am starting out with.
Currently, it will just be an energy regeneration calculator, however, as I continue to work on the project, there may be more features. No promises though, as I use my own personal time to work on this.
Thanks!

Jason
