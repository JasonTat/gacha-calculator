Hi! This is a full stack personal project that I'm creating in ASP.NET Blazor + MS SQL Server. 

Not really built for monetization or anything like that; I just wanted to build something where I could check how long / when my 'energy' in these games replenish, without having to start each game up.

Currently, the games that the app has are:
- Honkai Star Rail
- Genshin Impact
- Arknights (Okay i need to do a little more for this because there is no "maximum cap" because it goes up each time you level up")
- Punishing Gray Raven
- Wuthering Waves

There could be more, but these are the ones that I am starting out with.
Currently, it will just be an energy regeneration calculator, however, as I continue to work on the project, there may be more features. No promises though, as I use my own personal time to work on this.
Thanks!

Jason
